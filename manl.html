            <h2>Find a Game</h2>
            <p class="reg">Not every Live Action Role Play game focuses on the same elements.  It is important to consider what you are looking for when you start taking stock of the games in your area.  First, consider what brought you to the conclusion that LARP was something you desired to try.
                <ul>
                    <li>Q:Was it reading about heroic adventures and the quirky personalities contained in the dog-eared, water-stained pages of your favorite novel?</li>
                    <li>A: Then perhaps it is the roleplay element you are drawn to.  High Fantasy games contain a strong roleplay element and may focus less on other aspects to be balanced in favor of intense interactions between characters.</li>
                    <li>Q: Has your couch conformed to your shape from the after-work gaming and Netflix?</li>
                    <li>LARP in general is a great way to get an entire weekend of cardio that is so much fun you won't realize how much you're running around.</li>
                    <li>Q: You know about LARP through your friend and have spent many hours drooling over their costume drooling over the craftmanship and materials they used?</li>
                    <li>A: You may be looking for a High Immersion game that requires a strong level of creativity and realism in the creation of character costumes.</li>
                    <li>Q: You're the high octane sort of person that wakes up at 6am every morning to go jogging before work, and you practice martial arts three times a week.  Your friend's roleplay game looks like it's for sissies.  You don't want to talk to orcs, you want to smash their skulls.</li>
                    <li>A: That's a legitimate reason to look for a good game, and there are plenty of combat-focused games that can satisfy your need for steel on plate action.  Just keep in mind that there will ALWAYS be a safety element to games, because under that orc mask is a friend's face.</li>
                </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2>Know the Rules</h2>
            <p class="reg">When you have chosen a game and locked down your place by purchasing your first ticket, you still might not be ready to jump in feet first.  These are some of the most important things to consider before you go into a new game, especially as a first-time LARPer.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The MOST important rules are the safety rules.  Many games have boffer weapons made of foam and tape around a core, and others have latex weapons.  Most games have rules concerning striking zones, such as avoiding the head and genitals of other players when attacking them, and striking speed, such as swinging from your wrist instead of shoulder, or swinging from no more than a 45 degree angle at the elbow.</li>
                <li>All games should have a way to indicate that you need a 'personal hold,' which is a way to signal to the players who are 'in game' that you need a moment to collect yourself without breaking their immersion.  All games should also have a way to indicate a 'safety hold' which is a call that each player repeats until the entire gaming field halts.  This is used in case of bodily harm or medical need, such as an asthma attack, a bad fall, or even someone losing their glasses in a nighttime field battle.</li>
                <li>Games with an intense roleplay element may have a way to discreetly check on someone's emotional status after a particularly traumatic event.  This is important when the play lasts for multiple days, and things that happen to a person's character bleed into their actual emotional status, making them feel unstable or unsafe, as though the game events are really happening to them.  In my experience, it is common for some of the best roleplayers/actors to be taken so seriously that other less experienced or less devoted players misconstrue the event and take it personally.  It is understandable that not everyone is as good at compartmentalizing their character's feelings and their own feelings.  <blockquote>Example: An orc barbarian is rescued in battle by a diffident elf, and afterward begins to admire him.  When the orc professes these unusual feelings, the elf rejects the orc out of hand, stating that it is a laughable assumption that an elf would find an orc to be anything but intolerable.  When the orc player begins to cry, the elf player confirms that the orc player realizes that the hurtful comment was IN Game, not Out of Game, and not intended toward the player, only their character.  Nothing should ever be done to intentionally hurt another Player, but a lot of roleplay-intense LARPs encourage healthy In Game conflict such as this.  Of course, conflict can sometimes cause misunderstandings.</blockquote></li>
                <li>Beyond safety rules there are also common elements to be aware of.  One of these is a Monstering Shift.  Most games are run by a small amount of staff.  Imagine seven people running a whole game for two-hundred.  There are hardly enough game staff to play all the monsters that Characters get to encounter, so many games have Monstering rules that give you a set of skills and health points to use for a couple of hours.  You may get to wander around town and randomly decide who to attack, or you may have a set purpose.</li>  <blockquote>Example: You are a four foot red goblin with 25 health points who can throw fire bolts and attack with a single knife.  You have black stones that you are to place around the cabin of a particular Character in town as part of a ritual.  A boss monster played by game staff will show up if you complete your task without the Characters in town killing you.  If you die, you give 5 gold to the Character that killed you, then you go out of game to get further direction from game staff.</blockquote>
                <li>Specific Game Rules: Each game has its own set of rules regarding spells, skills, leveling up, Health, and Mana/Magic.  The most important sets to know within these sometimes very complex rules are:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Your Character Class and their skills / spells.  Know what you can do so that when someone takes your skill/spell hit, you can tell them what to do about it.  <q>That spell paralyzes you for 1 minute</q> or <q>That skill binds your right leg to the ground for 10 seconds, but you can still attack from there</q> are very helpful to other players unfamiliar with your Class's skills.</li>
                    <li>Main Statuses that can affect your character.  You don't need to know every class and spell in the game, but familiarize yourself with how to react to the status effects of things in game.  It helps to know that <q>I just hit you with a web</q> means that you cannot move until you are killed or another Character comes over and pretends to cut you free of the webbing.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Not all players are comfortable acting, but everyone appreciates it when you do.  In my experience, everyone's favorite character is the one who reacts to hits as though he/she is in pain, goes down quietly if they get assassinated, acts mad and complains to everyone in the tavern when you steal their gold without them noticing, acts drunk when they drink from a tankard, moans and flops around when they get poisoned, etcetera.  There are many ways to show your appreciation for the game world that everyone has collectively built, and roleplaying reactions to things other people do is what cements it all together.<blockquote>The local halfling tavernkeeper poisons the ale with diuretics and gives it to the bandits invading her town, gives them a few minutes to pass around the drink, and then announces out of game that the effect they take is <q>You have to GO.  Like... NOW.</q>  She wears a face of extreme satisfaction as the NPCs playing the bandits howl, grab their rears, and all run awkwardly to the outhouse, shoving and tripping over each other in their dedication to act out their comedic desperation.</blockquote></li>

            <h3>Definitions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In Game / In Play - A concept that defines what is part of the game world and visible to the characters, and what is out of the game world.  For example, cars and areas like bathrooms and bedrooms might be out of play which means the game players can go to these areas to take a break from the game world.  Areas like the campsite and buildings hosting the game may be in game, meaning that even if a player's character is in repose in an in game area, other characters can still interact with them - such as stealing their game money if they are taking an in game nap.</li>
                <li>Immersion - The ability of the LARP community to suspend reality and focus solely on the game world.  Imagine you are in a fel forest surrounded by goblinoids fighting for your life, and someone starts humming the Imperial March from Star Wars.  It just doesn't belong, and breaks the careful tapestry of fantasy the game community have created for each other.</li>
                <li>Players / Actors - This is you.</li>
                <li>Character / PC - PC stands for Player Character.  This is not you, but is played by you.  Your character reflects the abilities and personality that you created in order to interact with other people's characters in game.</li>
                <li>NPC / Monster - NPC stands for Non-Player Character.  Often monsters, but also often shopkeepers, tavern keepers, and game staff or rules marshals who are there to ensure that PC characters have interesting tasks and quests to understake, or to give them someone to fight.</li>
